## Installation

### Component library
 
Run the following command to add the component library to your project:
```zsh
npm install @folkehelseinstituttet/designsystem
```
**or,** if npm is not an option, you may use our CDN. Add the following script tag to your HTML file:
```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://zealous-field-027caf703.5.azurestaticapps.net/"
/>
```

<div style={{padding: ".25rem 1rem", background: "#FEE9E6", borderRadius: "2px", borderBottom: "4px solid #EC7C73", marginBottom: "2rem"}} >
<p>
We do not recommend using this approach in production.
It requires the client to download the entire library—regardless of
which components are actually used—which negatively impacts performance and bandwidth utilization.
</p>
Only use the CDN if installing the package with npm is not an option.

## Usage

### Angular
Angular has built-in support for Web Components, so you can use the components directly in your Angular project.
This is an axample of how to use the FHI Button component in an Angular project:

First we need to tell angular that we are using web components.
We do this by adding the  <a href="https://angular.dev/api/core/CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA">CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA</a> to the module decorator.
```ts
import { CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA } from '@angular/core';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule],
  schemas: [CUSTOM_ELEMENTS_SCHEMA],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})

```
Then, in your angular component typescript file, import the component you want to use. In this case we want to use `fhi-button`:
```ts
import '@folkehelseinstituttet/designsystem/fhi-button';
```

Now, use the component as if it was a normal html element in your angular component template file.
```html
<fhi-button (click)="console.log('you clicked me!')">Click me!</fhi-button>
```

### React

<div style={{padding: ".25rem 1rem", background: "#FFE7BA", borderRadius: "2px", borderBottom: "4px solid #F1A541", marginBottom: "2rem"}} >
FHI Designsystem supports React version 19 and above. We do not offer support for older versions of React.
</div>

In version 19 and above, React has seamless support for web components.
You can use them directly in your JSX code as if they were standard html elements.

This is an axample of how to use the FHI Button component in a React project:

First, in your React component file, import the component you want to use. In this case we want to use `fhi-button`:
```jsx
import '@folkehelseinstituttet/designsystem/fhi-button';
```

Now, use the component as if it was a normal html element in your React component:
```jsx
<fhi-button onClick={() => console.log('you clicked me!')}>Click me!</fhi-button>
```
